This was an assignment to implement a game involving multiple competing players, in a thread-safe fashion. The game involved having each player have ten pebbles and having to get their total weight of pebbles to hundred. They were able to do this by discarding one of their pebbles and having it replaced with a random one from a bag of pebbles. This game was created with the use of the technique pair programming.
